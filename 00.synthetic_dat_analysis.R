# This R file contains codes to extract individual-level and injection venue-level parameters for HIV transmission model. 
# The synthetic datasets are in the forms of .csv and .rds. 
# Columns in the synthetic dataset resemble the actual raw dataset and need to be cleaned and compiled. 
# The code below generates two datasets in the folder ~/data/cleaned:
# data_indiv = characteristics of hypothetical participants
# data_venue = characteristics of injection venues by compiling all participants who frequented an injection venue
# 
# Variable names correspond to these exact questions from the survey:
# record_id: unique participant ID
# redcap_event_name: specifies baseline dataset
# age: age calculated from participants' date of birth by the survey date OR directly from the question 'How old are you?'
# age_1st_inj: 'How old were you when you first injected drugs for non-medicinal purposes?'
# hiv: HIV-1 antibody results (1 = reactive, 0 = non-reactive)
# hiv_suppressed: HIV-1 detectable viral load (1 = 'â‰¥ 150 copies/mL', 0 = '< 150 copies/mL')
# hiv_aware: 'What were the results of your last HIV test?'
# inj_days_6mo: 'How many days total in the last 6 months did you inject any drugs?'
# inj_times_per_day: 'On days you injected, how many times a day did you inject?'
# MOUD_6mo: 'Have you used an opiate substitution program in the prior 6 months?'
# MOUD_days: 'How many days did you use an opioid substitution program in the prior 6 months?'
# SSP_6mo: 'Have you used a needle syringe exchange program in the prior 6 months?'
# SSP_days: 'How many days did you use the needle exchange program in the last 6 months?'
# ART_ever: 'Have you ever taken antiretroviral medications (tablets to control your HIV infection)?'
# ART_adhere: 'In the past 30 days, did you take any HIV medication?'
# test_ever: 'Have you ever been tested for HIV?'
# test_1mo: 'What is the best estimate of when you were last tested for HIV?' (1 = 'within the last month', 0 = more than 1 month)
# net_X_share (X from 1 to 20): 'How many times have you injected with XX in the prior 30 days? By injected I mean that you were in the same place when you injected and you may or may not have shared injection equipment with them.'
# net_X_syringe_days (X from 1 to 20): 'How many days have you shared needles with XX out of the past 30 days?'
# net_X_syringe_times (X from 1 to 20): 'How many times a day did you share needles with XX in the last 30 days?'
# spat_xxx_xx (identify from a map): 'Take a moment to think about the places where you may have injected in the past 6 months. It could be your house, your dealer s house, at a friend s place, 
# or a public space like a street corner or park or public toilet. If it helps, think back to the last day you injected and where your day started. Over the past 6 months, in which neighborhoods have you injected?'
